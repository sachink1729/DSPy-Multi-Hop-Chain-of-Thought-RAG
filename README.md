## Multi-Hop Chain of Thought with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Overview

This repository demonstrates the integration of Multi-Hop Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using DSPy. The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for combining these advanced AI techniques to enhance complex problem-solving capabilities.

### Features

- **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Utilizes chain of thought processes to solve multi-step problems.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Incorporates external knowledge retrieval to support and enhance generation tasks.
- **DSPy Integration**: Leverages the power of DSPy for managing and executing the pipeline.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sachink1729/DSPy-Multi-Hop-Chain-of-Thought-RAG.git
cd DSPy-Multi-Hop-Chain-of-Thought-RAG
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###Usage

Run the notebook to see the Multi-Hop CoT with RAG in action:
```bash
jupyter notebook multi_hop_cot_rag_dspy_indexify.ipynb
```
