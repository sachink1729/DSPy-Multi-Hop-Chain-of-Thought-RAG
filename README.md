# Multi-Hop Chain of Thought with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the integration of Multi-Hop Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using DSPy. The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for combining these advanced AI techniques to enhance complex problem-solving capabilities.

## Features

- **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Utilizes chain of thought processes to solve multi-step problems.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Incorporates external knowledge retrieval to support and enhance generation tasks.
- **DSPy Integration**: Leverages the power of DSPy for managing and executing the pipeline.

## Getting Started
